            <td><p1>Why I Am an Atheist (Hindi: मैं नास्तिक क्यों हूँ) is an essay written by Indian revolutionary Bhagat Singh 
                in 1930 in Lahore Central Jail.[1][2] The essay was a reply to his religious friends who thought Bhagat Singh 
                became an atheist because of his vanity.After the death of Singh, the essay was published on 27 September 1931
                in Lala Lajpat Rai's English weekly The People.After the death of Singh, the essay was published on 27 September
                1931 in Lala Lajpat Rai's English weekly The People.In the essay, Bhagat Singh states that his atheism was not a 
                result of vanity. He mentions that his family were firm believers in God, that he himself grew up as a religious 
                boy who would chant prayers for hours and goes on to explain how despite this he went on to become an atheist.[3] 
                He mentions that his atheism was also not a result of his association with a revolutionary organization and that most of his comrades 
                were in fact theists, citing the example of Sachindra Nath Sanyal who was a firm believer in God. An excerpt from the essay reads
                Later still I came across a book entitled Common Sense by Nirlamba Swami. It was only a sort of mystic atheism.
                This subject became of utmost interest to me. By the end of 1926 I had been convinced as to the baselessness of the 
                theory of existence of an almighty supreme being ..He mentions Mikhail Bakunin's manuscript, God and the State and Common
                Sense by Niralamba Swami to have inspired his own atheism
                He also questions theists about the existence of God:If, as you believe, there is an almighty, omnipresent, 
                omniscient and omnipotent God, who created the earth or world, please let me know why did he create it? This world of woes 
                and miseries, a veritable, eternal combination of numberless tragedies: Not a single soul being perfectly satisfied.
                Continuing on the above question, he also asks, "I ask why your omnipotent God does not stop every man when he is committing 
                any sin or offence? He can do it quite easily. Why did he not kill warlords or kill the fury of war in them and thus avoid the 
                catastrophe hurled down on the head of humanity by the Great War? Why does he not just produce a certain sentiment in the mind of the 
                British people to liberate India? Why does he not infuse the altruistic enthusiasm in the hearts of all capitalists to forego their
                rights of personal possessions of means of production and thus redeem the whole labouring community —nay, the whole human society, from the 
                bondage of capitalism? You want to reason out the practicability of socialist theory; I leave it for your almighty to enforce it. People recognise
                the merits of socialism in as much as the general welfare is concerned. They oppose it under 
                the pretext of its being impracticable. Let the Almighty step in and arrange everything in an orderly fashion."[3]
                In the end, he also comments on the origin of God and thinks it is due to man's limitation, weakness and shortcoming to face trying circumstances. 
                He differs on the origin of God from other radicals who attribute the origin of God to "the ingenuity of the exploiters who wanted to keep the people under their subjection by 
                preaching the existence of a supreme being and then claiming an authority and sanction from him for their privileged positions."[3]
                On the subject of origin of life and humanity, he comments, "This is a phenomenon 
                of nature. The accidental mixture of different substances in
                the shape of nebulae produced this earth. When? Consult history. 
                The same process produced animals and, in the long run, man. Read Darwin's Origin 
                of Species. And all the later progress is due to man's constant conflict with nature and his efforts to override it. 
                This is the briefest possible explanation of the phenomenon."[3]</p1>
